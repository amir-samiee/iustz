Working on this game project as our first experience in a four-person group was both enjoyable and interesting. The cohesion of project sections led to collaboration between two or more members working on each part of the project.

Coordination among the members and decision-making regarding the overall project progress were done in face-to-face meetings of the four members before the holidays, and during the holidays, these meetings occurred every 5 days in the Discord space. In each meeting, each member discussed the completed tasks and the tasks needed for the upcoming days and decisions were made for different sections.

The next challenge was the programming language and defaults. For example, it was decided from the beginning that the code should be written in camel case, etc., which was done through a vote by all 4 members.

Executing such group projects with a high number of members not only led to an increase in programming skills but also significantly enhanced communication within the group members in this field.

As a suggestion, we can point to increasing the number of projects with a higher number of members, which require more interaction compared to the two-person BP project.

Face-to-face sessions with mentors and consulting with experts for project sections and options could have had a positive impact.
