#### Zombie Missions

Explore the dark and treacherous realms infested by hordes of ravenous zombies. With escalating difficulty levels and the occasional appearance of formidable special zombie adversaries, survival becomes an ever-intensifying struggle.

Drawing upon a vast repository of enemy archetypes, the factory breathes life into the game world by spawning both common adversaries and formidable special enemies. With each encounter, players must remain vigilant and adapt their strategies to overcome evolving threats.

Employing a sophisticated Finite State Machine (FSM), the game seamlessly manages the dynamic generation of enemy encounters and factory operations.

Parameters such as enemy count, objectives, and rewards are carefully calibrated to ensure that players are continually challenged and rewarded for their efforts.
