"The Radio Tower Transmission"
Intercepting a distress signal coming from a radio tower in the distance,
you arrive to find that it is controlled by a group of survivors who are using it to lure unsuspecting travelers into their deadly traps. 
You can outsmart the survivors and claim the tower for yourself to send out your own distress signal.
